# Banking Management System
 This project is a console-based banking system that simulates basic banking operations for both users and administrators. It allows new customers to create accounts, log in, and manage their finances. Users can perform actions such as checking their balance, depositing money, and withdrawing funds. Administrative access provides the ability to view, add, update, and remove customer records. The system also includes authentication mechanisms to ensure secure access. Overall, it serves as a simple banking management tool designed for educational or demonstration purposes, emphasizing user interaction, data handling, and menu-driven functionality.
